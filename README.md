# stk (Stalwart Toolkit)

`stk` is a lightweight, modular toolkit for building games and game engines. It provides a **portable foundation** for dynamically loading modules, native or WASM, without enforcing any architecture or design choices.

It is designed to run on a wide range of systems, from retro consoles and embedded devices to modern PCs.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic module loading** (native `.so` / `.dll`)
- **Hot-swapping** of modules at runtime
- **Optional WASM support** for multi-language modules
- **Developer tools**: lightweight metadata, logging/tracing, and dependency management
- **Minimal, portable API**

---

`stk` is **non-opinionated**: developers control architecture, engine design, and game logic while relying on a predictable, lean foundation.
